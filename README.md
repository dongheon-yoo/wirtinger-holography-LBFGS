# Start
1. Please put the 'fminlbfgs_version2c' directory in the main directory. 
2. Put the image and write the image name 'im_name' in the 'main_gpu.m'
3. Run the 'main_gpu.m' code

# Acknowledgements
* I referred the code from OLAS project for double phase encoding method.
* Custom library of MATLAB for L-BFGS method by Dirk-Jan Kroon is used.
